The Simon Game is a classic memory game that challenges players to remember and repeat a growing sequence of colors and sounds. Here's a simple explanation:

The Simon Game is an electronic game that consists of four colored buttons:

ðŸ”µ Blue

ðŸŸ¥ Red

ðŸŸ¢ Green

ðŸŸ£ Purple 

Each button lights up and plays a unique sound when pressed

HOW IT WORKS :-
Step 1 - Start:
The game flashes one of the colored buttons.

Stap 2 - Repeat:
You must press the same color that lit up.

Stap 3 - Add One More:
In the next round, the game plays the same sequence plus one more color.

Stap 4 - Keep Going:
Repeat the entire sequence in the correct order as it gets longer each round.

Stap 5 - Game Over:
If you press the wrong button, the game ends.

YOUR GOAL :-
Repeat the longest sequence you can without making a mistake
